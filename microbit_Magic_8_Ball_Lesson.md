# microbit Magic 8 Ball Lesson  

To introduce python while loops to my students, we start the day by going through my While Loops colab.  
Then we build a microbit Magic 8-Ball.  

I walk them through building the Magic 8-Ball live coding with them.  This gives me a chance to explain while loops in more detail.  
And it is more fun to work together and use student input.  They come up with some funny 8-Ball responses.  I included some examples.  
I walk them through it, so I don't give them the link.  But, I basically follow the microbit.org project in the link below.

This can be done with just the simulator, but it is much more fun with physical microbits.  
After I load my program on my microbit, we ask it questions.  
'Will we be out of school for snow?'  
'Will the basketball team win?'  
Student questions are usually the funniest.
