# Music Lesson  

In this lesson, I have students go through 3 of the projects that are provided by microbit.org. 
I usually walk them through the lesson as a group.  It is more fun that way.  
Then I have them make their own song or try to recreate a famous song on the microbit.  
Before I leave them alone to make their song, I go through the Making Music with Micro:Bit website.  
I included a couple of the better examples of the student programs.  

## Assignment Instructions  
Using the micro:bit Python Editor, try the 3 examples below.  
Then code a python program to have your micro:bit play your own song.  
**Your will submit 4 .py files for this assignment.**  

For each, retitle the project and "Save Python script".  Then attach each (3).  
- Disco Lights
- Metronome
- Frere Jacques loops

Finally, create your own song or copy a real song that your micro:bit can play.  
Use for loops for the repeated sections and reduce your lines of code.  
The link "Making music with micro:bit" can help you with this.  
Retitle your song project, "Save Python script", and attach this .py file too.  

## Links to microbit.org Projects  
I attach these links to the assignment, so they don't have to search for the microbit projects:  
https://python.microbit.org/v/3/reference

## Link to Making Music with Micro:Bit
I think this is a great resource and reference for coding music into a microbit.  
I give them this link too.
