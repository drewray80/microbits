# microbits

This repo is a collection of projects that I use to teach programming in my high school courses.  
I plan to create a folder in this repo for each project. Since github repos can be challenging to organize, I created this repo to guide visitors to find projects that will suit their needs. 

## Outline of README
- Overview for how I use microbits
- CS Topics and the Actvities I use for each topic
- Other Projects that I use in class but don't directly go with a topic
- Future Projects that I hope to incorporate in my courses
  
## Overview  
As a high school computer science teacher, I really enjoy using microbits in my classes.  They offer lots of opportunities for students to learn programming using physical computing.  
Microbits have buttons, tons of sensors, leds, a small speaker, radio transmitter and reciever, accelerometer...   
They can also be used as a microcontroller for other devices.  In my classes, we use them to control Sphero RVR+ robots.  
They are a lot of fun and have many possibilities for students of all ages and ability levels.  
This repo was created to share how I use microbits in my courses to other teachers in case the information is usefull to someone else.  

## {Topics: Activities}
I use microbits throughout my Introduction to Programming course as well as in my Intermediate Programming course.  
These are the programming topics and the corrisponding microbit activity that I use:  
- Basics (variables, math equations, inputs...): Battery Tester  
- Conditionals (if/elif/else): If Battery Tester, Rock/Paper/Scissors, Fireflies, Level  
- While Loops: Magic 8 Ball
- For Loops: Music  
- Nested For Loops: LEDs
- Functions: functions would be great, but I do other activities (turtle, Caesar Cypher, GUI)
- Modules: Automatic Headlights for Sphero RVR+  

## Other Projects
These are some other activities and projects that I have done that I don't directly tie to a unit.  Some of them are extra lessons when I want to have an extra activity.  And some I use in my Intermediate Programming course.  
- Simon - like the game from the 80s where you match the pattern and the pattern gets increasingly longer
- RC Car - using 2 microbits that communicate using radio signals to turn a Sphero RVR+ into an rc car.
- Tilt Game - using the accelerometer to move the player LED on top of the food LED
- Banana Keyboard - we use students as the keyboard instead of bananas  
- Flappy Bird
- I also have some IoT kits from Elecfreaks that we use periodically 

## Future Projects  
I would also like to do these projects, but haven't yet.  
I will end up adjusting this projects, but the links below provide a general guide.  

- Temp/Light/Sound Data Logger: collect environmental data to analyze
