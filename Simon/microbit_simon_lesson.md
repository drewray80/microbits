# Simon  

I don't really have a lesson for this game.  
Basically, we just live code together as a class to make a clone of the Simon game from the 80s.

I usually lead the lesson/activity Socratically, asking questions and calling on students.  
When they finish, they have a little game that has room for improvements, if they want to make it better.  
I typically grade this activity for participation when they submit the code.

I attached a basic example and an improved version.  
The improved version has the lights flash more like the Simon game.  This was an improvement that one of my students thought of this year.
