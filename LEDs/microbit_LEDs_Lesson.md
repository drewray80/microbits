# microbit LEDs Lesson  

I added the slides for this lesson in this repo.  I use Google Slides in class, but hopefully the PowerPoint slides will work if you want them.  
I use python as the programming lanuage for my class, so we use the microbit python editor.  
https://python.microbit.org/v/3  

## Examples  
I also attached some good examples of student code from this activity in the repo.  

## Assignment Instructions  
These are the instructions that I post with in my Google Classroom assignment:
In class, we will practice using the 5x5 led array that is on the micro:bit.
Follow along in class to practice turning individual lights on and off, and using loops to create a light show.
When you are finished, retitle the project and "Save Python script".  
Submit your script to this assignment.
I attached slides for you to reference later and for students that are absent form class.

## Slides  
The slides have a lot of words, so the students can use them as a reference.  
During the lesson, I primarily give verbal instructions and live code examples in the microbit editor on my computer.
I like to take student suggestions, so we can create a program together during class before they try on their own.  

## Major Grade  
At the end of the Loops Unit, I give them the Loops Major Grade assignment.  The Loops Unit includes my Colabs on While Loops and For Loops, the microbit LEDs lesson, microbit Music lesson, and the microbit Magic-8 Ball lesson. Several of those programs this year were impressive to me.  They incorporated lights and music.  The examples are some of the better programs (they are not all that impressive).
