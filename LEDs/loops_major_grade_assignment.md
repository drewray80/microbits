# Loops Major Grade Assignment  

## Instructions  
These are the instructions that I give my students in Google Classroom:

For the Loops Major Grade, you can choose the program that you would like to create.  
You can create a LED show or song using the micro:bit python editor (turn in a python file, not hex).  
Or you can create a program in Codecademy in a Workspace or CodeHS Sandbox.  
Or if you have another idea for a program that will meet the criteria of the rubric ask me.  

I am allowing you to choose your program, so you can be creative in the creation of your program.  
Your grade will be determined using the attached rubric, so reference the rubric while you are developing your program.  

Your program will need to show that you have learned the following loop skills:  
- for loops  
- while loops  
- nested loops  

In the rubric for major grades, I always include points for Function and Errors.  
In addition to those categories, I am adding Creative and Comments to the major grades.  
- Creative points are gained by adding an explanation about why you are proud of your program, what you did that was different or creative.  
(It is 10 points so it only needs to be a few sentences, but the explanation must be included to get the points.)  
Submit a Google Doc with your assignment with your Creative explanation.  
- Comment points are gained by including comments in your code to explain your code.  
Comments should be brief and clear, but always included.  

## Rubric Points  
- For Loops: 20 points  
Does your program have at least 2 for loops?  
- While Loops: 20 points  
Does your program have at least 1 while loop?  
- Nested Loops: 10 points  
Does your program have nested loops?  
- Function: 20 points  
Did your program function correctly?  
- Errors: 10 points  
Is your program free of errors? (We all get errors. Did you fix all of the errors?)  
- Comments: 10 points  
Did you include useful comments in your code to explain the code for another developer?  
- Creative: 10 points  
Is your program creative, different, interesting...?  
Did you include an explanation (a few sentences) for the reason you should receive these points?
